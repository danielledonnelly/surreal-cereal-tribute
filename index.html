    <p id="tribute-info">From Bizarre to Brilliant: Decoding the Success of Surreal Branding</p>
    <p>Surrealist marketing has always been pretty hit or miss for me.</p>

    <p>Certain brands try far too hard to seem quirky and offbeat in their efforts to draw an audience. This results in a marketing strategy that relies on ham-fisted humor and out-dated trends in order to garner attention. Don't get me wrong, I'm pretty unfunny myself. I know I don't have much room to judge. But I think there's a distinction to be made between unfunny people and unfunny brands.</p>
    
    <p>When a friend makes a goofy joke or comment, it feels authentic. Even if what they say isn't particularly hilarious, it will often still be enough to make you smile.
    Yet the lame jokes would make us smile if they were coming from a friend can sound almost dystopian coming from companies. </p>
    
    <p>Without thoughtful execution, surrealist marketing campaigns can come off as downright alienating and tone-deaf to consumers. It can be strange seeing massive businesses with millions of dollars in revenue acting eccentric on social media just for some easy attention.</p>
    
    <p>Does anyone actually <i>want</i> to see their favourite fastfood chain referencing outdated memes and roasting customers on social media? I don't. It comes off as phony and, arguably much worse, unfunny. </p> 
    
    <p>Creating a brand that is both genuinely clever and authentic is no easy feat. It's hard to strike a balance between humor and authenticity. Yet there's once brand I've noticed that appears to do this almost effortlessly.</p>
    
    <p>Surreal.</p>

    <p>Surreal is, for lack of a better word, surreal.</p> 
    <p>It is a brand of healthy no-sugar cereal that aims to mimic the taste of your favourite childhood breakfast snacks. That's why they call it Surreal, according to their website: “because it shouldn't work, but it does, brilliantly.” This is also how I'd describe their marketing.</p> 

    <p>Surreal operates entirely out of the UK and—as far as I can tell—doesn't have international shipping. Their marketing has no business being so brilliant that it captures the attention of random folks across the globe. Yet here we are. Even though I may never get the chance to try Surreal, their marketing is so effective that I'm writing paragraphs about it anyways.</p>

    <p>Surreal's marketing manages to somehow be both surreal and real at the same time.</p>

    <p>Their social media posts are charming and fun. Their billboards are creative and interesting to look at. But they never try to distract you from the fact that they're advertising cereal. They're pretty straightforward and transparent about it.</p>

    <p>That's a major part of what gives Surreal its charisma. The marketing never feels as though its trying to be something its not.</p> 
    <p>Instead of a constant churn of half-baked humor, Surreal produces campaigns that are imaginative and entertaining, yet still remarkably down to earth. They never take themselves too seriously, yet you can tell that they put thought into everything they do (even when they try to make it seem like they don’t).</p>
