    <p>Surrealist marketing has always been pretty hit or miss for me.</p>

      Some brands try too hard to be relatable and quirky. The result is often a marketing strategy that relies on ham-fisted humor and out-dated trends in order to garner attention. Don’t get me wrong, I’m pretty unfunny myself. I know I don’t have much room to judge. But I think there’s a distinction to be made between unfunny people and unfunny brands.</p>
      
      Often times, the silly jokes and jabs that would make us smile if they were coming from a friend sound almost dystopian coming from companies, especially when they’re massive multinational corporations. Without thoughtful execution, surrealist marketing campaigns can come off as downright alienating and tone-deaf to consumers.</p> 
      
      Creating a brand that is both genuinely clever and authentic is no easy feat. Yet there’s once brand I’ve noticed that appears to do this almost effortlessly. </p>
      
      Surreal.
