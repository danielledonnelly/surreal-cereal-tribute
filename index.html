    <p id="tribute-info">From Bizarre to Brilliant: Decoding the Success of Surreal Branding</p>
    <p>Surrealist marketing has always been pretty hit or miss for me.</p>

    <p>Some brands go overboard in their attempts to seem quirky and offbeat. I've seen some businesses hop on this bandwagon despite it being completely misaligned with their brand identity, and the result can be jarring. </p>
  
    <p>When these companies rely on ham-fisted humor and out-dated trends in order to garner attention, it can come off as cringeworthy and painfully unfunny. </p>
    
    <p>Don't get me wrong, I can be pretty cringeworthy and unfunny myself. I could give the Wendy's Twitter account a run for their money. But I think there is a major distinction to be made between individuals acting goofy on social media and companies trying to replicate that behavior.</p>
      
    <p>Lame jokes that would make us smile or roll our eyes if they were coming from a friend can sound almost dystopian coming from companies. Nobody wants to see massive multinational corporations posting old memes and roasting their customers on social media. It comes off as tone deaf and incredibly out of touch.</p>
  
    <p>I don't say any of this to shame the companies that do try to make people laugh. Because at the end of the day, I get it. Humor is subjective. Online trends move fast, and there's a lot of pressure on social media managers to jump on every single one. It's easy to point the finger at brands that miss the mark, but it's also not too difficult to see where they're coming from.</p>

    <p>Humor is subjective and the internet moves fast. Acting as wacky as possible in hopes of attracting an audience can be a terribly dangerous game. It's not easy to create a brand identity that comes across as genuinely clever and authentic.</p>
      
    Yet there's once brand I've noticed that appears to do this almost effortlessly.
    
    <p>Surreal.</p>

    <p>Surreal is, for lack of a better word, surreal.</p> 
    <p>It is a brand of healthy no-sugar cereal that aims to mimic the taste of your favourite childhood breakfast snacks. That's why they call it Surreal, according to their website: “because it shouldn't work, but it does, brilliantly.” This is also how I'd describe their marketing.</p> 

    <p>Surreal operates entirely out of the UK and—as far as I can tell—doesn't have international shipping. Their marketing has no business being so brilliant that it captures the attention of random folks across the globe. Yet here we are. Even though I may never get the chance to try Surreal, their marketing is so effective that I'm writing paragraphs about it anyways.</p>

    <p>Surreal's marketing manages to somehow be both surreal and real at the same time.</p>

    <p>Their social media posts are charming and fun. Their billboards are creative and interesting to look at. But they never try to distract you from the fact that they're advertising cereal. They're pretty straightforward and transparent about it.</p>

    <p>That's a major part of what gives Surreal its charisma. The marketing never feels as though its trying to be something its not.</p> 
    <p>Instead of a constant churn of half-baked humor, Surreal produces campaigns that are imaginative and entertaining, yet still remarkably down to earth. They never take themselves too seriously, yet you can tell that they put thought into everything they do (even when they try to make it seem like they don’t).</p>
