    <p>Surrealist marketing has always been pretty hit or miss for me.</p>

      Some brands try too hard to be relatable and quirky. The result is often a marketing strategy that relies on ham-fisted humor and out-dated trends in order to garner attention. Don't get me wrong, I'm pretty unfunny myself. I know I don’t have much room to judge. But I think there's a distinction to be made between unfunny people and unfunny brands.</p>
      
      Often times, the silly jokes and jabs that would make us smile if they were coming from a friend sound almost dystopian coming from companies, especially when they're massive multinational corporations. Without thoughtful execution, surrealist marketing campaigns can come off as downright alienating and tone-deaf to consumers.</p> 
      
      Creating a brand that is both genuinely clever and authentic is no easy feat. Yet there's once brand I've noticed that appears to do this almost effortlessly. </p>
      
      Surreal.

      <p>Surreal is, for lack of a better word, surreal. 
      </p> 
      <p>It is a brand of healthy no-sugar cereal that aims to mimic the taste of your favourite childhood breakfast snacks. That's why they call it Surreal, according to their website: “because it shouldn't work, but it does, brilliantly.” This is also how I’d describe their marketing.</p> 

      <p>Surreal operates entirely out of the UK and—as far as I can tell—doesn't have international shipping. Their marketing has no business being so brilliant that it captures the attention of random folks across the globe. Yet here we are. Even though I may never get the chance to try Surreal, their marketing is so effective that I'm writing paragraphs about it anyways.</p>

      <figcaption id="img-caption">Surreal uses clever wordplay in an ad to allude to a certain well-known hazelnut spread</figcaption>

      <p>Surreal's marketing manages to somehow be both surreal and real at the same time.

        Their social media posts are charming and fun. Their billboards are creative and interesting to look at. But they never try to distract you from the fact that they're advertising cereal. They're pretty straightforward and transparent about it.
